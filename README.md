JavaScript Assessment 

What did you like about this project?
It is a quite nice challenge for me to test my skill and knowledge.

What did you struggle with in this project?
It is quite confuse when I choose to use loop at the beginning. But after code for a whileI think there is the better way to do the calling function while game is not end.
